# Active Recon


## Activity 2.1: Host Discovery
In this activity we were tasked with sweep through a range of IP's gathering infomration. Using `fping` we created a bash script that could scrub trhougha determined set of IP's and run the command

`fping -a -g 10.0.5.2 10.0.5.50`

We then have to send that output to a txt file for data collection, this is done by utilizing `>`. The uses for this script is to be modified throught this activity and the course. Its going to built off of and recreated to suit different needs.

The next part if this activity involves creating anither bash script that utilizes `nmap`
